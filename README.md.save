# Green Sole Compression + LLM Pipeline

This repo demonstrates how **data compression algorithms** can be applied orthogonally to our in-house LLM at Green Sole. 

Instead of altering the model weights, compression is introduced at different layers of the pipeline to reduce:
- **Storage costs**
- **Latency in inference**
- **Bandwidth for farmer ↔ ERP ↔ AI assistant communication**

## How it Works

1. **Farmer Input (Text/Voice)**
   - Inputs are compressed (gzip / Huffman) before being sent to the assistant.
   - Orthogonal because the LLM operates on decompressed, clean text.

2. **Drone & Sensor Images**
   - Compressed via AVIF/WebP before uploading.
   - The LLM then uses metadata + extracted features (not the raw heavy image).

3. **ERP + Logs**
   - Transaction logs compressed with Zstandard.
   - Keeps backend lean and syncable on low-bandwidth networks.

4. **Model Compression**
   - Quantization and pruning reduce LLM storage + speed up inference.
   - This is separate from pipeline compression, but complementary.

## Orthogonal Design Principle

Compression acts as an **overlay**:
- It doesn’t modify the model’s architecture.
- It ensures efficient input/output handling around the LLM.
- Farmers, ERP, and the AI assistant all benefit without retraining.

## Next Steps
- Implement progressive compression for 3D virtual farm models.
- Add benchmarks (bandwidth saved, latency improved).
- Deploy on edge devices (low-cost farmer phones).

## LeetCode Connections

This repo also includes **LeetCode-style solutions** that map to compression + LLM integration concepts:

- **String Compression (LC443):** Farmer query reduction before LLM inference.
- **Decode String (LC394):** Decompress logs & inputs into usable text.
- **TinyURL Encoding (LC535):** Simulating URL compression in ERP data syncing.
- **Trie (LC208):** Foundation for dictionary-based compression in ERP logs.
- **Clone Graph (LC133):** Analogous to 3D farm model compression.

These problems help us test and validate compression principles on smaller scales before applying them to Green Sole.
